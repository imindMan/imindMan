<h1>👋 Hi guys!</h1>
<p>
  A short introduction about me 👀
  <p>My real name is Dong, from Vietnam. My nickname is imindMan, a short form of "illusory-mind Man", sorry if you think I am a big guy of Apple 🍎(actually don't =)))))😁</p>
  
  <p>I'm a student 👨‍🎓 and still learning how to code like a pro 👩‍💻. I am seriously learning about software engineering. And I learn (not seriously) about game development 🎮🎮, specifically 
Unity.</p>
  <p>I'm good at logical thinking and programming 👩‍💻👩‍💻👨‍💻, maybe I'm patient to, especially researching documents 📄📃📄.</p>
  <p>Now ⌚⏲, it's time to: SAY "HELLO WORLD" 🌎🌐🌍🌏</p>
</p>
