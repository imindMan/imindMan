# A short introduction about me 👀
> Nothing special

> -imindMan

Somehow I'm not a newbie anymore. But, I'm still lol. 🤡

My real name is **Thái Lê Khánh Đông**. I'm from **Vietnam** 🇻🇳 and I'm currently a **high-school student** 🏫. I'm **still learning** how to code like a pro 👩‍💻. 

I love **Linux** 🐧, and ***I use Arch Linux, btw***. But somehow you'll still meet me using **Microsoft products**, that's because I'm **forced to use them.**

As expected, I'm another **alone coder**. **~~I'm good at coding~~.** and I still **wanna reach to the expert level.**

# Something special about me 
As I said, nothing special.

Well, I'm **a student**, and currently **a solo coder**. But I still **wanna contribute some free and open-source softwares** (because I'm a big fan of **FOSS** and **LINUS TORVALD** 🐧 🐧).

I **mainly code** in **Python, Java, C/Assembly** and **currently learn how to code Rust/Go, JavaScript**
